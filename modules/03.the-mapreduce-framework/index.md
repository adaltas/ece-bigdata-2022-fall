# The MapReduce framework

## HDFS + YARN architecture recap

## MapReduce: a framework

MapReduce was made to help people write applications that:

- Process vast amounts of data (TB scale)
- On large clusters (thousands of nodes)
- In a reliable, fault-tolerant manner

## MapReduce: Application steps

Input = key/value pairs

1. **Map:** input k/v pairs to intermediate k/v pairs
2. **Shuï¬€le & sort:** dispatch the k/v pairs with the same key to
   the same reduce
3. **Reduce:** set of values which share a key to smaller set of
   values

## MapReduce: Word count example

## MapReduce: Distribution on a cluster

Schema

## MapReduce: Important properties

- Outputs are written to disk between each step
- The number of mappers depends on the number of blocks
- The number of reducers depends on the number of
  workers involved

## MapReduce vs other frameworks

- MapReduce was the ancestor of YARN
- Today, other frameworks that perform better are used:
  - [Apache Tez](https://tez.apache.org/)
  - [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
